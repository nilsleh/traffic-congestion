# traffic-congestion
In this project I want to do some basic data exploration with traffic congestion data in jupyter notebooks. Furthermore, I want to experiment with different ways of visualizing geographical data. One way is using a street shapefile as a basemap to plot over, another is the folium library which uses OpenStreetMap as a base map. As folium plots can currently not be displayed on github directly, rendering the jupyter notebook through nbviewer. By clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nilsleh/traffic-congestion/blob/master/Data_Visualization%20.ipynb), you can see the notebook in the nbviewer.
